# MATLAB to Python Conversion Summary

This document summarizes the MATLAB files that have been converted to Python format.

## Files Converted in This PR

### 1. calculateDice.m → calculate_dice.py
**Purpose**: Calculate Dice similarity coefficient between two contours

**Key Features**:
- Uses bit operations to extract specific structures from VOI
- Calculates volumetric overlap using Dice coefficient formula: `2|X∩Y| / (|X|+|Y|)`
- Handles edge case where both volumes are empty (returns 1.0)

**Dependencies**: numpy

### 2. calculatePathLength.m → calculate_path_length.py
**Purpose**: Calculate path lengths between contours with tolerance

**Key Features**:
- Resamples contours using RTSTRUCT coordinates and CT data
- Applies distance transform with configurable tolerance
- Calculates path length differences per slice
- Reports slices with missing contours

**Dependencies**: numpy, scipy, resample_contour_slices

### 3. calculatePathLength_interpolated.m → calculate_path_length_interpolated.py
**Purpose**: Calculate path lengths handling interpolated slices

**Key Features**:
- Identifies and handles interpolated slices in contours
- Adapts second contour to exclude interpolated slices
- Calculates multiple metrics: added path length, original path length, new contour path length
- Reports slice comparison statistics

**Dependencies**: numpy, resample_contour_slices

### 4. read_dicomct.m → read_dicomct.py
**Purpose**: Full DICOM CT reader with IEC convention

**Key Features**:
- Reads DICOM CT files and applies IEC coordinate convention
- Sorts slices by Y position
- Extracts comprehensive metadata (pixel spacing, dimensions, positions)
- Handles manufacturer-specific private tags
- Applies Hounsfield unit conversion (RescaleSlope/RescaleIntercept)
- Transforms image to IEC format (permutations and flips)

**Dependencies**: numpy, pydicom

### 5. calculateDifferentPathLength_v2.m
**Note**: This file was already converted in a previous effort as `calculate_different_path_length_v2.py`

## Testing

All converted modules have been tested:

1. **test_new_conversions.py**: Specific tests for newly converted modules
   - Tests basic functionality and edge cases
   - Validates structure and imports

2. **test_basic_functionality.py**: Updated to include all new modules
   - Comprehensive import testing
   - Integration with existing modules

## Conversion Patterns

The conversions follow these consistent patterns:

1. **Naming Convention**: MATLAB camelCase → Python snake_case
2. **Array Indexing**: MATLAB 1-indexed → Python 0-indexed
3. **Matrix Operations**: MATLAB → NumPy
4. **Distance Transform**: MATLAB's `bwdistsc` → SciPy's `distance_transform_edt`
5. **Bit Operations**: MATLAB `bitget` → Python bit shift and mask
6. **Documentation**: MATLAB comments → Python docstrings

## Code Quality

- All functions include comprehensive docstrings with Parameters and Returns sections
- Type hints are documented in docstrings
- Edge cases are handled (e.g., empty volumes, division by zero)
- Progress messages maintained for consistency with existing codebase
- All tests pass successfully
