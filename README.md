# pyAPL

Python scripts for calculating the Added Path Length (APL) and other contour comparison metrics for medical imaging (DICOM RTSTRUCT).

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts converted from MATLAB for quantifying differences between contours delineated by different methods or persons. The main batch file `quantify_contour_differences.py` orchestrates all other modules to compute:

- **Volumetric DICE**: Dice similarity coefficient based on volume overlap
- **Added Path Length (APL)**: Path length differences between contours
- **Surface DICE**: Dice coefficient based on surface overlap

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- PyDICOM
- scikit-image
- pandas

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielslobUM/pyAPL.git
cd pyAPL
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python quantify_contour_differences.py
```

This will:
1. Prompt you to select a folder containing imaging data (CT scans)
2. Prompt you to select RTSTRUCT files for method/person 1 (reference)
3. Prompt you to select RTSTRUCT files for method/person 2 (comparison)
4. Ask you to select which structures (OARs) to compare
5. Calculate metrics and save results to CSV

### Python API

You can also use the function programmatically:

```python
from quantify_contour_differences import quantify_contour_differences

# Calculate all parameters (DICE, APL, Surface DSC)
results = quantify_contour_differences(calc_all_parameters=1, root_folder='/path/to/data')

# Calculate only DICE (faster)
results = quantify_contour_differences(calc_all_parameters=0, root_folder='/path/to/data')
```
